Currently <strong>GetIstio</strong> runs on Linux and MacOS. To deploy GetIstio, all you need is this one simple command:

```sh
curl -sL https://tetrate.bintray.com/getistio/download.sh | bash
```

Please follow [GetIstio Install and Update Page]({{< ref "/getistio-cli/install-and-update-of-getistio" >}}) for detailed instruction on downloading and subsequent steps to have GetIstio up and running in your machine.

There are additional pages that allow download of <strong>Istio distributions and istioctl</strong> binaries for [Linux]({{< relref "linux" >}}), [MacOS]({{< relref "macos" >}}), and [Windows]({{< relref "windows" >}}). We recommend using GetIsio to obtain the required files.

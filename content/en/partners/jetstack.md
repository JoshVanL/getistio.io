Jetstack helps businesses to build and operate modern cloud native infrastructure with Kubernetes. Weâ€™ve been
contributing to the Kubernetes ecosystem since the beginning. We started
[cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) as an open source project to improve automation of certificate
management within Kubernetes. Cert-manager builds natively on top of the Kubernetes API and has become the de facto
solution for issuing and renewing certificates from popular public and private certificate issuers.
